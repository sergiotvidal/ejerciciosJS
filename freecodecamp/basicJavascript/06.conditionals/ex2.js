// Create an if statement inside the function to return "Yes, that was true" if the parameter wasThatTrue is true and return "No, that was false" otherwise.

// Example
function ourTrueOrFalse(isItTrue) {
  if (isItTrue) {
    return "Yes, it's true";
  }
  return "No, it's false";
}

// Setup
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
  return wasThatTrue ? "Yes, that was true" : "No, that was false";
}

// Change this value to test
trueOrFalse(true);
